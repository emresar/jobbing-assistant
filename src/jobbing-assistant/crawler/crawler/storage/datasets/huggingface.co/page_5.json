We trained BERT for token classification (multi-label), to identify: - Generalizations - Unfairness - Stereotypes HF Space:  maximuspowers/bias-detection-ner Article on Training: https://huggingface.co/blog/maximuspowers/bias-entity-recognition Pls reach out with ideas!! Lot's more info coming soon, our research group has workshops and a hackathon planned for launching this open source project.

The results are in, undeniable proof that Transformers models CAN learn symbolic relationships. Undeniable proof that AI can learn its ABC's. Credit goes to myself, Claude, and ChatGPT. I would not be able to prove this without Claude or ChatGPT. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8jHRgahRfY       \ud83d\udc4d  5  5     \ud83d\udc40  2  2     +           Xenova    posted an update  4 days ago   view post  Post  3859   Reply         I can't believe this...

All the code and data  patched-codes/synth-vuln-fixes on how we did it is available on their GitHub - https://github.com/openai/build-hours/tree/main/5-4o_fine_tuning . Here are some tips based on our experience: \u2192 Establish baseline with \"conditioning\" / prompting \u2192 Task-specific datasets are ideal for PEFT; hard to beat gpt-4o on \"broad\" tasks \u2192 Add your best system prompt to each example \u2192 Ensure training data distribution is similar to inference data \u2192 Shorten instructions with concise prompts; may require more examples. \u2192 Define clear evaluation metrics (seriously, please eval!)

These neurons work together by learning from (input) data and getting better at tasks (in the hidden layer) to give (output) predictions or decisions.      \ud83d\udc4d  6  6     +           merve    posted an update  3 days ago   view post  Post  2598   Reply         a new shape-optimized SigLIP just dropped \ud83d\udc40  google/siglip-so400m-patch14-224      \ud83d\udd25  7  7     \ud83d\ude80  4  4     \ud83e\udd17  1  1     \ud83d\ude0e  1  1     +      Load more   Recently active users      TuringsSolutions    Richard A Aragon  Follow       clem    Clem \ud83e\udd17  Follow       isidentical    Batuhan  Follow       Xenova    Joshua  Follow       maximuspowers    Maximus Powers  Follow       vikhyatk    vik  Follow       hlky    hlky  Follow       jjokah    John Johnson  Follow       codelion    Asankhaya Sharma  Follow       merve    Merve Noyan  Follow     Company  \u00a9 Hugging Face  TOS  Privacy  About  Jobs   Website  Models  Datasets  Spaces  Pricing  Docs     "}
