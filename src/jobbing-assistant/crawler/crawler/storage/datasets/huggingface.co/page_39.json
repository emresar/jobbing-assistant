Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.   T5-Base is the checkpoint with 220 million parameters.

We can even apply T5 to regression tasks by training it to predict the string representation of a number instead of the number itself.   See the blog post and research paper for further details.

Training Details       Training Data   The model is pre-trained on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) , which was developed and released in the context of the same research paper as T5.  The model was pre-trained on a on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised (1.) and supervised tasks (2.) .\nThereby, the following datasets were being used for (1.) and (2.):   Datasets used for Unsupervised denoising objective :    C4  Wiki-DPR    Datasets used for Supervised text-to-text language modeling objective    Sentence acceptability judgment  CoLA Warstadt et al., 2018    Sentiment analysis  SST-2 Socher et al., 2013    Paraphrasing/sentence similarity  MRPC Dolan and Brockett, 2005  STS-B Ceret al., 2017  QQP Iyer et al., 2017    Natural language inference  MNLI Williams et al., 2017  QNLI Rajpurkar et al.,2016  RTE Dagan et al., 2005   CB De Marneff et al., 2019    Sentence completion  COPA Roemmele et al., 2011    Word sense disambiguation  WIC Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2018    Question answering  MultiRC Khashabi et al., 2018  ReCoRD Zhang et al., 2018  BoolQ Clark et al., 2019         Training Procedure   In their abstract , the model developers write:   In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks.   The framework introduced, the T5 framework, involves a training procedure that brings together the approaches studied in the paper. See the research paper for further details.      Evaluation       Testing Data, Factors & Metrics   The developers evaluated the model on 24 tasks, see the research paper for full details.
